This directory contains input files for the standard simulation as of
the GEOS-Chem version 9-01-03.

This set of input files was used for the 1-month benchmark.

The restart file contains the tracer concentrations from the end of a 10+ year
spinup simulation using Lee Murray's linearized stratospheric chemistry scheme
updates.
