This directory contains input files for the standard simulation as of
the GEOS-Chem version 9-01-03.

This set of input files was used for the 1-month benchmark.

The restart file is obtained from the 1-year benchmark simulation
v9-01-03-Release-geos5-Run1. The benchmark simulation was initialized with
tracer concentrations from the end of a 10+ year spinup simulation using
Lee Murray's linearized stratospheric chemistry scheme updates.
